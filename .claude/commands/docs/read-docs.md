# Read Documentation (Warm-up)

Read ALL documentation files to understand project context before working on tasks.

## Instructions

Read ALL these files in PARALLEL, ALL OF THEM, not just one or two, ALL:

### Core Docs (docs/)

- docs/overview.md
- docs/usage.md
- docs/cicd.md
- docs/components/1-background.md
- docs/components/2-editor.md
- docs/components/3-floating-ui.md
- docs/components/4-storage.md
- docs/components/5-sources.md

### Project Config

- CLAUDE.md
- README.md

## Output

After reading, provide a brief summary:

1. Current system architecture (1-2 sentences)
2. Key components and their purpose
3. Important types/interfaces and storage structure
4. Any context relevant to the upcoming task
